Firms offers a new way of building chatbots that requires no training data or coding experience.

ZeroShotBot announced the launch of a new disruptive conversational AI technology that democratises chatbots for businesses of all sizes.

Developed by award-winning computer scientists, ZeroShotBot offers a new way of building chatbots that require no training data, allowing anyone with zero coding experience to create a fully functional chatbot.

ZeroShotBot works by harnessing the power of zero-shot learning, which means that a machine learning model performs tasks they have never seen before. These bots require no training data in order to interact on the subject matter and can be accessed and configured by anyone, with no technical knowledge or experience necessary.
